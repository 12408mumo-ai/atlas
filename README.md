# ATLAS — the world you carry

A personal tracking sanctuary named for the Greek Titan who holds up the sky.
Built with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, and a hand-made Greek design language
(parchment scrolls, gold leaf, meander borders, orbiting spheres).

## The journey

1. **`/` and `/login`** — Enter Atlas without an account. Your world is stored
   locally in this browser.
2. **`/hub`** — A simple home page with links to each part of your world.
3. Choose a section to open it:

| Sphere | Greek | Page(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **Work** | Ἔργον | `/work` (projects, steps, clock tools) → `/study` |
| **Study** | Μάθησις | `/study` (timetable, courses, assignments/exams, self-learning, session log) |
| **People** | Ἄνθρωποι | `/people` (profiles, dates, promises, gifts, check-ins) |
| **Life** | Βίος | `/life` (goals, places, experiences and personal aspirations) |
| **Memories** | Μνῆμαι | `/memories` (journal, on-this-day, cross-pillar logs) |

Work and Study are the same pillar's two chambers — linked both ways.

## Design system

- **Type**: the requested Typekit kit (`https://use.typekit.net/iyo4kyx.css`) is
  loaded in `app/layout.tsx` with `--font-display / --font-body / --font-ui`
  variables. Graceful fallbacks (Cinzel, Cormorant Garamond, Jost) are linked so
  the Greek feeling holds even if the kit does not resolve.
- **Ornaments**: `components/Ornaments.tsx` — meander borders, laurel dividers,
  twinkling starfield, Greek-key corners.
- **Home**: `app/hub/page.tsx` — accessible links to the six sections.

## AI

The previous assistant, voice-command interface and provider integrations have
been removed while a replacement is planned. Existing chat, plans and settings
remain in browser storage; they are not shown or sent to a provider. The old
AI settings may include an API key in localStorage under `atlas.ai.v1`; the old
voice key may remain in sessionStorage under `atlas.voice.test.v1`. Remove those
entries using browser developer tools if you no longer need them.

## Life

Keep goals, places, things to do and the person you want to become. Things to do
can include an image. Entries are stored locally; the previous Life data remains
in the saved world even though it is no longer displayed on the Life page.

## State

Local-first. World data, Memories, assistant settings, and chat live in browser
`localStorage`, seeded with example data. Clearing browser data can erase them.
Life images, gallery photos and videos are stored in the browser too and are subject to its
limited storage quota. Previously uploaded remote media may no longer be available.
Existing account-specific browser caches are not automatically imported into the
local world, and previously cloud-synced data is not automatically downloaded.

## Run

Node.js 20.9 or later is required. The Next.js 16 upgrade removes `next lint`;
use the type-check command below until an ESLint configuration is added.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```
